Here I have made the SpringProject... I have made it on Spring Tool Suite (sts) run it as a spring boot application, 
The API's endpoints are provided in the Controller Package Classes named as AdminController, SubjectController & AuthController,
The student entity is named as User entity for better readability and to avoid redundancy of Code as admin and Student both are Users and I have already define their Roles in separate table using enum,
I have made all the API's as directed
Implementation of API's are present in different packages
